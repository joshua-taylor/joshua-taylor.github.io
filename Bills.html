        <h4>How to read this chart</h4>
        <p><i>Note that this is best viewed on a large screen device.</i><br>Each line represents a bill passing through the UK Parliament. A bill is essentially a proposal to change the law in some way. Bills must pass through both the House of Commons and be approved by the reigning monarch before becoming an Act through Royal Assent.</p>
        <p>Each circle on the chart represents the furthest point a Bill has traveled. Circles on the top line are Bills that have successfully passed into Law.</p>
        <p>Circles are colour-coded; the colour of a circle represents the sponsoring party.</p>
        <p>Hover over each circle to display more information on it. Click on a circle to view the full detail of the Bill (opens in a new tab). </p>
